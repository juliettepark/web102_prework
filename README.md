## Notes

Some challenges:
* I needed a refresher on DOM API and it took extra googling to figure out what to append and which elements to nest.
* I wanted to make the website as responsive as possible so styling took extra time.
* Brain switching over to JavaScript after using Python for so long (kept forgetting "let")!
* Remembering CSS styling commands and sometimes figuring out bugs when nothing was changing on screen!

However, I learned a lot and was surprised at how much fun I had. Thank you CodePath <3
